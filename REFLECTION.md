In my first attempt at doing the assignment, I had a hard time setting up Django and installing the required applications. 
Fixing the errors was tough, but after doing some research and asking friends online, I was able to solve the problems little by little. 
After starting my virtual environment, another set of problems occurred, but I immediately resolved them as I launched VS Code and began my Python journey of creating a website using Django.

It took me quite some time to complete the assignment since my laptop was not configured the same way as my teacherâ€™s computer. 
Those were just minor issues, but the bigger challenge came when GitHub was introduced. I started to experience complications because I was not familiar with using it. 
Thankfully, having a video recording of the class was very helpful since I could rewatch it to check any steps I had missed.

Overall, despite the struggles, I found the experience fun and rewarding.
